# Adaptive Learning
Wanna be able to read a paper from a domain you know nothing about? Use our tool to get explanations of every term used in the paper and gain quick overview of the domain. A concept is used in the explanation that you donâ€™t know? Go deeper again until you reach the explanation of for example addition or any simple concept that a 5 years old could understand, if he knows how to read of course ! Built using ChatGPT and other sources, [Documentation]()
