        "text": "In a common family of neural network language\nmodels, the current input word is represented as\nthe vector c\u2208IRCand is projected to a dense\nrepresentation using a word embedding matrix U.\nSome computation is then performed on the word\nembedding U\u22a4c, which results in a vector of ac-\ntivationsh2. A second matrix Vthen projects h2\nto a vector h3containing one score per vocabulary\nword:h3=Vh2. The vector of scores is then con-\nverted to a vector of probability values p, which\nrepresents the models\u2019 prediction of the next word,\nusing the softmax function.\nFor example, in the LSTM-based lan-\nguage models of (Sundermeyer et al., 2012;\nZaremba et al., 2014), for vocabulary of size C,\nthe one-hot encoding is used to represent the input\ncandU\u2208IRC\u00d7H. An LSTM is then employed,which results in an activation vector h2that\nsimilarly to U\u22a4c, is also in IRH. In this case, U\nandVare of exactly the same size.\nWe callUthe input embedding, and Vthe\noutput embedding. In both matrices, we expect\nrows that correspond to similar words to be sim-\nilar: for the input embedding, we would like the\nnetwork to react similarly to synonyms, while in\nthe output embedding, we would like the scores\nof words that are interchangeable to be simi-\nlar (Mnih and Teh, 2012).\nWhileUandVcan both serve as word embed-\ndings, in the literature, only the former serves this\nrole. In this paper, we compare the quality of the\ninput embedding to that of the output embedding,\nand we show that the latter can be used to improve\nneural network language models. Our main results\nare as follows: (i) We show that in the word2vec\nskip-gram model, the output embedding is only\nslightly inferior to the input embedding. This is\nshown using metrics that are commonly used in or-\nder to measure embedding quality. (ii) In recurrent\nneural network based language models, the output\nembedding outperforms the input embedding. (iii)\nBy tying the two embeddings together, i.e., enforc-\ningU=V, the joint embedding evolves in a more\nsimilar way to the output embedding than to the in-\nput embedding of the untied model. (iv) Tying the\ninput and output embeddings leads to an improve-\nment in the perplexity of various language mod-\nels. This is true both when using dropout or when\nnot using it. (v) When not using dropout, we pro-\npose adding an additional projection PbeforeV,\nand apply regularization to P.

Their\nresurgence was initiated by (Bengio et al., 2003).\nRecurrent neural networks were \ufb01rst used for\nlanguage modeling in (Mikolov et al., 2010)\nand (Pascanu et al., 2013). The \ufb01rst model\nthat implemented language modeling with\nLSTMs (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997)\nwas (Sundermeyer et al., 2012). Follow-\ning that, (Zaremba et al., 2014) introduced\na dropout (Srivastava, 2013) augmented\nNNLM. (Gal, 2015; Gal and Ghahramani, 2016)\nproposed a new dropout method, which is referred\nto as Bayesian Dropout below, that improves on\nthe results of (Zaremba et al., 2014).\nThe skip-gram word2vec model introduced\nin (Mikolov et al., 2013a; Mikolov et al., 2013b)\nlearns representations of words. This model learns\na representation for each word in its vocabulary,\nboth in an input embedding matrix and in an\noutput embedding matrix. When training is\ncomplete, the vectors that are returned are the\ninput embeddings. The output embedding is\ntypically ignored, although (Mitra et al., 2016;\nMnih and Kavukcuoglu, 2013) use both the\noutput and input embeddings of words\nin order to compute word similarity. Re-\ncently, (Goldberg and Levy, 2014) argued that\nthe output embedding of the word2vec skip-\ngram model needs to be different than the input\nembedding.\nAs we show, tying the input and the output em-\nbeddings is indeed detrimental in word2vec. How-\never, it improves performance in NNLMs.\nIn neural machine translation (NMT)\nmodels (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013;\nCho et al., 2014; Sutskever et al., 2014;\nBahdanau et al., 2014), the decoder, which\ngenerates the translation of the input sentence in\nthe target language, is a language model that is\nconditioned on both the previous words of the out-\nput sentence and on the source sentence. State of\nthe art results in NMT have recently been achieved\nby systems that segment the source and target\nwords into subword units (Sennrich et al., 2016a).\nOne such method (Sennrich et al., 2016b) is based\non the byte pair encoding (BPE) compression al-\ngorithm (Gage, 1994). BPE segments rare words\ninto their more commonly appearing subwords.\nWeight tying was previously used in the log-bilinear model of (Mnih and Hinton, 2009), but\nthe decision to use it was not explained, and\nits effect on the model\u2019s performance was not\ntested. Independently and concurrently with\nour work (Inan et al., 2016) presented an ex-\nplanation for weight tying in NNLMs based\non (Hinton et al., 2015).",

        "text": "In this work, we employ three different model cat-\negories: NNLMs, the word2vec skip-gram model,\nand NMT models. Weight tying is applied sim-\nilarly in all models. For translation models, we\nalso present a three-way weight tying method.\nNNLM models contain an input embedding ma-\ntrix, two LSTM layers ( h1andh2), a third hidden\nscores/logits layer h3, and a softmax layer. The\nloss used during training is the cross entropy loss\nwithout any regularization terms.\nFollowing (Zaremba et al., 2014), we employ\ntwo models: large and small. The large model em-\nploys dropout for regularization. The small model\nis not regularized. Therefore, we propose the fol-\nlowing regularization scheme. A projection matrix\nP\u2208IRH\u00d7His inserted before the output embed-\nding, i.e., h3=VPh2. The regularizing term\n\u03bb/bardblP/bardbl2is then added to the small model\u2019s loss\nfunction. In all of our experiments, \u03bb= 0.15.\nProjection regularization allows us to use the\nsame embedding (as both the input/output embed-\nding) with some adaptation that is under regular-\nization. It is, therefore, especially suited for WT.\nWhile training a vanilla untied NNLM , at\ntimestep t, with current input word sequence\ni1:t= [i1,...,it]and current target output word\not, the negative log likelihood loss is given by:\nLt=\u2212logpt(ot|i1:t), where pt(ot|i1:t) =\nexp(V\u22a4\noth(t)\n2)\n/summationtextC\nx=1exp(V\u22a4xh(t)\n2),Uk(Vk) is thekth row of U(V),\nwhich corresponds to word k, andh(t)\n2is the vector\nof activations of the topmost LSTM layer\u2019s output\nat timet. For simplicity, we assume that at each\ntimestept,it/ne}ationslash=ot. Optimization of the model is\nperformed using stochastic gradient descent.\nThe update for row kof the input embedding is:\n\u2202Lt\n\u2202Uk=/braceleftBigg\n(/summationtextC\nx=1pt(x|i1:t)\u00b7V\u22a4\nx\u2212V\u22a4\not)\u2202h(t)\n2\n\u2202Uitk=it\n0 k/negationslash=it\nFor the output embedding, row k\u2019s update is:\n\u2202Lt\n\u2202Vk=/braceleftBigg\n(pt(ot|i1:t)\u22121)h(t)\n2k=ot\npt(k|i1:t)\u00b7h(t)\n2 k/negationslash=oTherefore, in the untied model, at every timestep,\nthe only row that is updated in the input embed-\nding is the row Uitrepresenting the current input\nword. This means that vectors representing rare\nwords are updated only a small number of times.\nThe output embedding updates every row at each\ntimestep.\nIntied NNLMs , we setU=V=S. The\nupdate for each row in Sis the sum of the updates\nobtained for the two roles of S as both an input and\noutput embedding.\nThe update for row k/ne}ationslash=itis similar to the up-\ndate of row kin the untied NNLM\u2019s output embed-\nding (the only difference being that U and V are\nboth replaced by a single matrix S). In this case,\nthere is no update from the input embedding role\nofS.\nThe update for row k=it, is made up of a term\nfrom the input embedding (case k=it) and a term\nfrom the output embedding (case k/ne}ationslash=ot). The\nsecond term grows linearly with pt(it|i1:t), which\nis expected to be close to zero, since words sel-\ndom appear twice in a row (the low probability\nin the network was also veri\ufb01ed experimentally).\nThe update that occurs in this case is, therefore,\nmostly impacted by the update from the input em-\nbedding role of S.\nTo conclude, in the tied NNLM, every row of S\nis updated during each iteration, and for all rows\nexcept one, this update is similar to the update of\nthe output embedding of the untied model. This\nimplies a greater degree of similarity of the tied\nembedding to the untied model\u2019s output embed-\nding than to its input embedding.\nThe analysis above focuses on NNLMs for\nbrevity. In word2vec , the update rules are simi-\nlar, just that h(t)\n2is replaced by the identity func-\ntion. As argued by (Goldberg and Levy, 2014), in\nthis case weight tying is not appropriate, because\nifpt(it|i1:t)is close to zero then so is the norm\nof the embedding of it. This argument does not\nhold for NNLMs, since the LSTM layers cause a\ndecoupling of the input and output embedddings.\nFinally, we evaluate the effect of weight ty-\ning in neural translation models . In this model:\npt(ot|i1:t,r) =exp(V\u22a4\notG(t))\n/summationtextCt\nx=1exp(V\u22a4xG(t))wherer=\n(r1,...,rN)is the set of words in the source sen-\ntence,UandVare the input and output embed-\ndings of the decoder and Wis the input embed-\nding of the encoder (in translation models U,V\u2208\nIRCt\u00d7HandW\u2208IRCs\u00d7H, whereCs/Ctis theLanguage Subwords Subwords Subwords\npairs only in source only in target in both\nEN\u2192FR 2K 7K 85K\nEN\u2192DE 3K 11K 80K\nTable 1: Shared BPE subwords between pairs of languages.\nsize of the vocabulary of the source / target).

The scores are then converted to prob-\nability values using the softmax function.\nIn our weight tied translation model, we tie the\ninput and output embeddings of the decoder.\nWe observed that when preprocessing the ACL\nWMT 2014 EN \u2192FR1and WMT 2015 EN \u2192DE2\ndatasets using BPE, many of the subwords ap-\npeared in the vocabulary of both the source and\nthe target languages. Tab. 1 shows that up to\n90% (85%) of BPE subwords between English and\nFrench (German) are shared.\nBased on this observation, we propose three-\nway weight tying (TWWT), where the input em-\nbedding of the decoder, the output embedding of\nthe decoder and the input embedding of the en-\ncoder are all tied. The single source/target vocab-\nulary of this model is the union of both the source\nand target vocabularies. In this model, both in the\nencoder and decoder, all subwords are embedded\nin the same duo-lingual space.",
