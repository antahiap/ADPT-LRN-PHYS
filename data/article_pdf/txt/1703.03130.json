        "text": "Much progress has been made in learning semantically meaningful distributed representations of\nindividual words, also known as word embeddings (Bengio et al., 2001; Mikolov et al., 2013).\nOn the other hand, much remains to be done to obtain satisfying representations of phrases and\nsentences. Those methods generally fall into two categories. The \ufb01rst consists of universal sentence\nembeddings usually trained by unsupervised learning (Hill et al., 2016). This includes SkipThought\nvectors (Kiros et al., 2015), ParagraphVector (Le & Mikolov, 2014), recursive auto-encoders (Socher\net al., 2011; 2013), Sequential Denoising Autoencoders (SDAE), FastSent (Hill et al., 2016), etc.\nThe other category consists of models trained speci\ufb01cally for a certain task. They are usually\ncombined with downstream applications and trained by supervised learning. One generally \ufb01nds\nthat speci\ufb01cally trained sentence embeddings perform better than generic ones, although generic\nones can be used in a semi-supervised setting, exploiting large unlabeled corpora. Several models\nhave been proposed along this line, by using recurrent networks (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997;\nChung et al., 2014), recursive networks (Socher et al., 2013) and convolutional networks (Kalchbren-\nner et al., 2014; dos Santos & Gatti, 2014; Kim, 2014) as an intermediate step in creating sentence\nrepresentations to solve a wide variety of tasks including classi\ufb01cation and ranking (Yin & Sch \u00a8utze,\n2015; Palangi et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2016; Feng et al., 2015). A common approach in previous\nmethods consists in creating a simple vector representation by using the \ufb01nal hidden state of the\nRNN or the max (or average) pooling from either RNNs hidden states or convolved n-grams. Ad-\nditional works have also been done in exploiting linguistic structures such as parse and dependence\ntrees to improve sentence representations (Ma et al., 2015; Mou et al., 2015b; Tai et al., 2015).\nFor some tasks people propose to use attention mechanism on top of the CNN or LSTM model to\nintroduce extra source of information to guide the extraction of sentence embedding (dos Santos\net al., 2016). However, for some other tasks like sentiment classi\ufb01cation, this is not directly appli-\ncable since there is no such extra information: the model is only given one single sentence as input.\nIn those cases, the most common way is to add a max pooling or averaging step across all time steps\n\u0003Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2017\nwe.\nhada\n.........w2w3 wn w4h2h3h4... hnMAi2Ai3Ai4...

The sentence embedding Mis computed as\nmultiple weighted sums of hidden states from a bidirectional LSTM ( h1; :::;hn), where the summa-\ntion weights ( Ai1; :::; A in) are computed in a way illustrated in (b). Blue colored shapes stand for\nhidden representations, and red colored shapes stand for weights, annotations, or input/output.\n(Lee & Dernoncourt, 2016), or just pick up the hidden representation at the last time step as the\nencoded embedding (Margarit & Subramaniam, 2016).\nA common approach in many of the aforementioned methods consists of creating a simple vector\nrepresentation by using the \ufb01nal hidden state of the RNN or the max (or average) pooling from\neither RNNs hidden states or convolved n-grams. We hypothesize that carrying the semantics along\nall time steps of a recurrent model is relatively hard and not necessary. We propose a self-attention\nmechanism for these sequential models to replace the max pooling or averaging step. Different from\nprevious approaches, the proposed self-attention mechanism allows extracting different aspects of\nthe sentence into multiple vector representations. It is performed on top of an LSTM in our sentence\nembedding model. This enables attention to be used in those cases when there are no extra inputs. In\naddition, due to its direct access to hidden representations from previous time steps, it relieves some\nlong-term memorization burden from LSTM. As a side effect coming together with our proposed\nself-attentive sentence embedding, interpreting the extracted embedding becomes very easy and\nexplicit.\nSection 2 details on our proposed self-attentive sentence embedding model, as well as a regular-\nization term we proposed for this model, which is described in Section 2.2. We also provide a\nvisualization method for this sentence embedding in section 2.3. We then evaluate our model in\nauthor pro\ufb01ling, sentiment classi\ufb01cation and textual entailment tasks in Section 4.",

These set of summation weight vectors are dotted\nwith the LSTM hidden states, and the resulting weighted LSTM hidden states are considered as\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2017\nbe applied on a downstream application. Figure 1 shows an example when the proposed sentence\nembedding model is applied to sentiment analysis, combined with a fully connected layer and a\nsoftmax layer. Besides using a fully connected layer, we also proposes an approach that prunes\nweight connections by utilizing the 2-D structure of matrix sentence embedding, which is detailed\nin Appendix A. For this section, we will use Figure 1 to describe our model.\nSuppose we have a sentence, which has ntokens, represented in a sequence of word embeddings.\nS= (w1;w2;\u0001\u0001\u0001wn) (1)\nHerewiis a vector standing for a ddimentional word embedding for the i-th word in the sentence.\nSis thus a sequence represented as a 2-D matrix, which concatenates all the word embeddings\ntogether. Sshould have the shape n-by-d.\nNow each entry in the sequence Sare independent with each other. To gain some dependency be-\ntween adjacent words within a single sentence, we use a bidirectional LSTM to process the sentence:\n\u0000 !ht=\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000!LSTM (wt;\u0000\u0000!ht\u00001) (2)\n \u0000ht= \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000LSTM (wt; \u0000\u0000ht+1) (3)\nAnd we concatenate each\u0000 !htwith \u0000htto obtain a hidden state ht. Let the hidden unit number for each\nunidirectional LSTM be u. For simplicity, we note all the n hts asH, who have the size n-by-2u.\nH= (h1;h2;\u0001\u0001\u0001hn) (4)\nOur aim is to encode a variable length sentence into a \ufb01xed size embedding. We achieve that by\nchoosing a linear combination of the nLSTM hidden vectors in H. Computing the linear combina-\ntion requires the self-attention mechanism. The attention mechanism takes the whole LSTM hidden\nstates Has input, and outputs a vector of weights a:\na=softmax\u0000\nws2tanh\u0000\nWs1HT\u0001\u0001\n(5)\nHere Ws1is a weight matrix with a shape of da-by-2u. and ws2is a vector of parameters with\nsizeda, where dais a hyperparameter we can set arbitrarily. Since His sized n-by-2u, the anno-\ntation vector awill have a size n. the softmax (_)ensures all the computed weights sum up to 1.\nThen we sum up the LSTM hidden states Haccording to the weight provided by ato get a vector\nrepresentation mof the input sentence.\nThis vector representation usually focuses on a speci\ufb01c component of the sentence, like a special set\nof related words or phrases. So it is expected to re\ufb02ect an aspect, or component of the semantics in\na sentence. However, there can be multiple components in a sentence that together forms the overall\nsemantics of the whole sentence, especially for long sentences. (For example, two clauses linked\ntogether by an \u201dand.\u201d) Thus, to represent the overall semantics of the sentence, we need multiple m\u2019s\nthat focus on different parts of the sentence. Thus we need to perform multiple hops of attention.\nSay we want rdifferent parts to be extracted from the sentence, with regard to this, we extend the\nws2into a r-by-damatrix, note it as Ws2, and the resulting annotation vector abecomes annotation\nmatrix A. Formally,\nA=softmax\u0000\nWs2tanh\u0000\nWs1HT\u0001\u0001\n(6)\nHere the softmax (_)is performed along the second dimension of its input. We can deem Equation\n6 as a 2-layer MLP without bias, whose hidden unit numbers is da, and parameters are fWs2; Ws1g.\nThe embedding vector mthen becomes an r-by-2uembedding matrix M. We compute the r\nweighted sums by multiplying the annotation matrix Aand LSTM hidden states H, the resulting\nmatrix is the sentence embedding:\nM=AH (7)",

However, we found that not very stable in our case. We conjecture\nit is because we are maximizing a set of KL divergence (instead of minimizing only one, which is\nthe usual case), we are optimizing the annotation matrix A to have a lot of suf\ufb01ciently small or\neven zero values at different softmax output units, and these vast amount of zeros is making the\ntraining unstable. There is another feature that KL doesn\u2019t provide but we want, which is, we want\neach individual row to focus on a single aspect of semantics, so we want the probability mass in the\nannotation softmax output to be more focused. but with KL penalty we cant encourage that.\nWe hereby introduce a new penalization term which overcomes the aforementioned shortcomings.\nCompared to the KL divergence penalization, this term consumes only one third of the computation.\nWe use the dot product of Aand its transpose, subtracted by an identity matrix, as a measure of\nredundancy.\nP=\r\r\u0000\nAAT\u0000I\u0001\r\r\nF2(8)\nHerek\u000fkFstands for the Frobenius norm of a matrix.

Because of the softmax, all entries\nwithin any summation vector in Ashould sum up to 1. Thus they can be deemed as probability\nmasses in a discrete probability distribution. For any non-diagonal elements aij(i6=j)in the AAT\nmatrix, it corresponds to a summation over elementwise product of two distributions:\n0< aij=nX\nk=1ai\nkaj\nk<1 (9)\nwhere ai\nkandaj\nkare the k-th element in the aiandajvectors, respectively. In the most extreme case,\nwhere there is no overlap between the two probability distributions aiandaj, the correspond aijwill\nbe 0. Otherwise, it will have a positive value. On the other extreme end, if the two distributions are\nidentical and all concentrates on one single word, it will have a maximum value of 1. We subtract\nan identity matrix from AATso that forces the elements on the diagonal of AATto approximate\n1, which encourages each summation vector aito focus on as few number of words as possible,\nforcing each vector to be focused on a single aspect, and all other elements to 0, which punishes\nredundancy between different summation vectors.",

Additionally, using our method we can easily create visualizations\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2017\nSome recent work have also proposed supervised methods that use intra/self-sentence attention. Ling\net al. (2015) proposed an attention based model for word embedding, which calculates an attention\nweight for each word at each possible position in the context window. However this method cannot\nbe extended to sentence level embeddings since one cannot exhaustively enumerate all possible\nsentences. Liu et al. (2016a) proposes a sentence level attention which has a similar motivation but\ndone differently. They utilize the mean pooling over LSTM states as the attention source, and use\nthat to re-weight the pooled vector representation of the sentence.\nApart from the previous 2 variants, we want to note that Li et al. (2016) proposed a same self\nattention mechanism for question encoding in their factoid QA model, which is concurrent to our\nwork. The difference lies in that their encoding is still presented as a vector, but our attention\nproduces a matrix representation instead, with a specially designed penalty term. We applied the\nmodel for sentiment anaysis and entailment, and their model is for factoid QA.\nThe LSTMN model (Cheng et al., 2016) also proposed a very successful intra-sentence level atten-\ntion mechanism, which is later used by Parikh et al. (2016). We see our attention and theirs as having\ndifferent granularities. LSTMN produces an attention vector for each of its hidden states during the\nrecurrent iteration, which is sort of an \u201donline updating\u201d attention. It\u2019s more \ufb01ne-grained, targeting\nat discovering lexical correlations between a certain word and its previous words. On the contrary,\nour attention mechanism is only performed once, focuses directly on the semantics that makes sense\nfor discriminating the targets. It is less focused on relations between words, but more on the seman-\ntics of the whole sentence that each word contributes to. Computationally, our method also scales up\nwith the sentence length better, since it doesn\u2019t require the LSTM to compute an annotation vector\nover all of its previous words each time when the LSTMN computes its next step.",

        "text": "In this paper, we introduced a \ufb01xed size, matrix sentence embedding with a self-attention mecha-\nnism. Because of this attention mechanism, there is a way to interpret the sentence embedding in\ndepth in our model. Experimental results over 3 different tasks show that the model outperforms\nother sentence embedding models by a signi\ufb01cant margin.\nIntroducing attention mechanism allows the \ufb01nal sentence embedding to directly access previous\nLSTM hidden states via the attention summation. Thus the LSTM doesn\u2019t need to carry every piece\nof information towards its last hidden state. Instead, each LSTM hidden state is only expected to\nprovide shorter term context information around each word, while the higher level semantics, which\nrequires longer term dependency, can be picked up directly by the attention mechanism. This setting\nreliefs the burden of LSTM to carry on long term dependencies. Our experiments also support that,\nas we observed that our model has a bigger advantage when the contents are longer. Further more,\nthe notion of summing up elements in the attention mechanism is very primitive, it can be something\nmore complex than that, which will allow more operations on the hidden states of LSTM.\nThe model is able to encode any sequence with variable length into a \ufb01xed size representation,\nwithout suffering from long-term dependency problems. This brings a lot of scalability to the model:\nwithout any modi\ufb01cation, it can be applied directly to longer contents like paragraphs, articles, etc.\nThough this is beyond the focus of this paper, it remains an interesting direction to explore as a\nfuture work.\nAs a downside of our proposed model, the current training method heavily relies on downstream\napplications, thus we are not able to train it in an unsupervised way. The major obstacle towards\nenabling unsupervised learning in this model is that during decoding, we don\u2019t know as prior how\nthe different rows in the embedding should be divided and reorganized. Exploring all those possible\ndivisions by using a neural network could easily end up with over\ufb01tting. Although we can still do\nunsupervised learning on the proposed model by using a sequential decoder on top of the sentence\nembedding, it merits more to \ufb01nd some other structures as a decoder.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the developers of Theano (Theano Development Team,\n2016) and Lasagne.

This results in needing more pa-\nrameters in the subsequent fully connected layer, which connects every hidden units to every units\nin the matrix sentence embedding. Actually in the example shown in Figure 1, this fully connected\nlayer takes around 90% percent of the parameters. See Table 4. In this appendix we are going to\nintroduce a weight pruning method which, by utilizing the 2D structure of matrix embedding, is able\nto drastically reduce the number of parameters in the fully connected hidden layer.\nInheriting the notation used in the main paper, let the matrix embedding Mhas a shape of rbyu,\nand let the fully connected hidden layer has bunits. The normal fully connected hidden layer will\nrequire each hidden unit to be connected to every unit in the matrix embedding, as shown in Figure\n1. This ends up with r\u0002u\u0002bparameters in total.\nHowever there are 2-D structures in the matrix embedding, which we should make use of. Each\nrow (miin Figure 1) in the matrix is computed from a weighted sum of LSTM hidden states, which\nmeans they share some similarities\nTo re\ufb02ect these similarity in the fully connected layer, we split the hidden states into requally sized\ngroups, with each group having punits. The i-th group is only fully connected to the i-th row in\nthe matrix representation. All connections that connects the i-th group hidden units to other rows\nof the matrix are pruned away. In this way, Simillarity between different rows of matrix embedding\nare re\ufb02ected as symmetry of connecting type in the hidden layer. As a result, the hidden layer can\nbe interperated as also having a 2-D structute, with the number ( r) and size ( p) of groups as its\ntwo dimensions (The Mvin Figure 6). When the total number of hidden units are the same (i.e.,\nMh Mv\nuq\nru\nMm1m2miMh Mv\nuq\np\nrru\nFigure 6: Hidden layer with pruned weight connections. Mis the matrix sentence embedding, Mv\nandMhare the structured hidden representation computed by pruned weights.\nTable 4: Model Size Comparison Before and After Pruning\nHidden layer Softmax Other Parts Total Accuracy\nYelp, Original, b=3000 54M 15K 1.3M 55.3M 64.21%\nYelp, Pruned, p=150, q=10 2.7M 52.5K 1.3M 4.1M 63.86%\nAge, Original, b=4000 72M 20K 1.3M 73.2M 80.45%\nAge, Pruned, p=25,q=20 822K 63.75K 1.3M 2.1M 77.32%\nSNLI, Original, b=4000 72M 12K 22.9M 95.0M 84.43%\nSNLI, Pruned, p=300, q=10 5.6M 45K 22.9M 28.6MPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2017\nr\u0002p=b), this process prunes away (r\u00001)=rof weight values, which is a fairly large portion when\nris large.\nOn the other dimension, another form of similarity exists too. For each vector representation miin\nM, thej-th element mijis a weighted sum of an LSTM hidden unit at different time steps. And for\na certain j-th element in all vector representations, they are summed up from a same LSTM hidden\nunit. We can also re\ufb02ect this similarity into the symmetry of weight connections by using the same\npruning method we did above. Thus we will have another 2-D structured hidden states sized u-by-q,\nnoted as Mhin Figure 6.\nTable 4 takes the model we use for yelp dataset as a concrete example, and compared the number of\nparameters in each part of the model, both before and after pruning. We can see the above pruning\nmethod drastically reduces the model size. Note that the pandqin this structure can be adjusted\nfreely as hyperparameters. Also, we can continue the corresponding pruning process on top of Mv\nandMhover and over again, and end up with having a stack of structured hidden layers, just like\nstacking fully connected layers.\nThe subsequent softmax layer will be fully connected to both MvandMh, i.e., each unit in the\nsoftmax layer is connected to all units in MvandMh. This is not a problem since the speed of\nsoftmax is largely dependent of the number of softmax units, which is not changed.In addition, for\napplications like sentiment analysis and textural entailment, the softmax layer is so tiny that only\ncontains several units.\nExperimental results in the three datasets has shown that, this pruning mechanism lowers perfor-\nmances a bit, but still allows all three models to perform comparable or better than other models\ncompared in the paper.\nB D ETAILED STRUCTURE OF THE MODEL FOR SNLI D ATASET\nIn Section 4.3 we tested our matrix sentence embedding model for the textual entailment task on\nthe SNLI dataset. Different from the former two tasks, the textual entailment task consists of a pair\nof sentences as input. We propose to use a set of multiplicative interactions to combine the two\n.........MhMpFh FpGated EncoderHypothesis Premise Fr.........\nw1 w2 w3 wn w4Mh\n... ... w1 w2 w3 wn w4Mp\n... ...Fh FpGated Encoder\nHypothesis Premise Fr\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2017\nmatrix embeddings extracted for each sentence. The form of multiplicative interaction is inspired\nbyFactored Gated Autoencoder (Memisevic, 2013).\nThe overall structure of our model for SNLI is dipicted in Figure 7. For both hypothesis and premise,\nwe extract their embeddings ( MhandMpin the \ufb01gure) independently, with a same LSTM and\nattention mechanism. The parameters of this part of model are shared (rectangles with dashed orange\nline in the \ufb01gure).\nComparing the two matrix embeddings corresponds to the green dashed rectangle part in the \ufb01gure,\nwhich computes a single matrix embedding ( Fr) as the factor of semantic relation between the two\nsentences. To represent the relation between MhandMp,Frcan be connected to MhandMp\nthrough a three-way multiplicative interaction . In a three-way multiplicative interaction, the value\nof anyone of Fr,MhandMpis a function of the product of the others. This type of connection is\noriginally introduced to extract relation between images (Memisevic, 2013). Since here we are just\ncomputing the factor of relations ( Fr) from MhandMp, it corresponds to the encoder part in the\nFactored Gated Autoencoder in Memisevic (2013). We call it Gated Encoder in Figure 7.\nFirst we multiply each row in the matrix embedding by a different weight matrix. Repeating it\nover all rows, corresponds to a batched dot product between a 2-D matrix and a 3-D weight tensor.\nInheriting the name in (Memisevic, 2013), we call the resulting matrix as factor . Doing the batched\ndot for both hypothesis embedding and premise embedding, we have FhandFp, respectively.\nFh=batcheddot (Mh; Wfh) (10)\nFp=batcheddot (Mp; Wfp) (11)\nHereWfhandWfpare the two weight tensors for hypothesis embedding and premise embedding.\nThe factor of the relation ( Fr) is just an element-wise product of FhandFp(the triangle in the\nmiddle of Figure 7):\nFr=Fh\fFp (12)\nHere\fstands for element-wise product. After the Frlayer, we then use an MLP with softmax",
