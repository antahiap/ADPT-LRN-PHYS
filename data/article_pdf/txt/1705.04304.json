        "text": "Text summarization is the process of automatically generating natural language summaries from an\ninput document while retaining the important points. By condensing large quantities of information\ninto short, informative summaries, summarization can aid many downstream applications such as\ncreating news digests, search, and report generation.\nThere are two prominent types of summarization algorithms. First, extractive summarization sys-\ntems form summaries by copying parts of the input (Dorr et al., 2003; Nallapati et al., 2017). Second,\nabstractive summarization systems generate new phrases, possibly rephrasing or using words that\nwere not in the original text (Chopra et al., 2016; Nallapati et al., 2016).\nNeural network models (Nallapati et al., 2016) based on the attentional encoder-decoder model for\nmachine translation (Bahdanau et al., 2014) were able to generate abstractive summaries with high\nROUGE scores. However, these systems have typically been used for summarizing short input\nsequences (one or two sentences) to generate even shorter summaries. For example, the summaries\non the DUC-2004 dataset generated by the state-of-the-art system by Zeng et al. (2016) are limited\nto 75 characters.\nNallapati et al. (2016) also applied their abstractive summarization model on the CNN/Daily Mail\ndataset (Hermann et al., 2015), which contains input sequences of up to 800 tokens and multi-\nsentence summaries of up to 100 tokens. But their analysis illustrates a key problem with attentional\nencoder-decoder models: they often generate unnatural summaries consisting of repeated phrases.\nWe present a new abstractive summarization model that achieves state-of-the-art results on the\nCNN/Daily Mail and similarly good results on the New York Times dataset (NYT) (Sandhaus,\n2008). To our knowledge, this is the \ufb01rst end-to-end model for abstractive summarization on the\nNYT dataset. We introduce a key attention mechanism and a new learning objective to address the\nrepeating phrase problem: (i) we use an intra-temporal attention in the encoder that records previous\nFigure 1: Illustration of the encoder and decoder attention functions combined. The two context\nvectors (marked \u201cC\u201d) are computed from attending over the encoder hidden states and decoder\nhidden states. Using these two contexts and the current decoder hidden state (\u201cH\u201d), a new word is\ngenerated and added to the output sequence.\ntakes into account which words have already been generated by the decoder. (ii) we propose a new\nobjective function by combining the maximum-likelihood cross-entropy loss used in prior work with\nrewards from policy gradient reinforcement learning to reduce exposure bias.\nOur model achieves 41.16 ROUGE-1 on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset. Moreover, we show, through\nhuman evaluation of generated outputs, that our model generates more readable summaries com-\npared to other abstractive approaches.",

There are two main reasons for this discrepancy. The \ufb01rst\none, called exposure bias (Ranzato et al., 2015), comes from the fact that the network has knowledge\nof the ground truth sequence up to the next token during training but does not have such supervision\nwhen testing, hence accumulating errors as it predicts the sequence. The second reason is due to\nthe large number of potentially valid summaries, since there are more ways to arrange tokens to\nproduce paraphrases or different sentence orders. The ROUGE metrics take some of this \ufb02exibility\ninto account, but the maximum-likelihood objective does not.",

Attention mechanisms (Bahdanau et al., 2014) make these models more\nperformant and scalable, allowing them to look back at parts of the encoded input sequence while\nthe output is generated.

We observe that the intra-decoder attention func-\ntion helps our model achieve better ROUGE scores\non the CNN/Daily Mail but not on the NYT dataset.\nFurther analysis on the CNN/Daily Mail test set\nshows that intra-attention increases the ROUGE-1\nscore of examples with a long ground truth sum-\nmary, while decreasing the score of shorter sum-\nmaries, as illustrated in Figure 2. This con\ufb01rms\nour assumption that intra-attention improves per-\nformance on longer output sequences, and explains\nwhy intra-attention doesnt improve performance on\nthe NYT dataset, which has shorter summaries on\naverage.\nIn addition, we can see that on all datasets, both the\nRL and ML+RL models obtain much higher scores than the ML model. In particular, these methods\nclearly surpass the state-of-the-art model from Nallapati et al. (2016) on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset,\nas well as the lead-3 extractive baseline (taking the \ufb01rst 3 sentences of the article as the summary)\nand the SummaRuNNer extractive model (Nallapati et al., 2017).\nSee et al. (2017) also reported their results on a closely-related abstractive model the CNN/DailyMail\nbut used a different dataset preprocessing pipeline, which makes direct comparison with our numbers\ndif\ufb01cult. However, their best model has lower ROUGE scores than their lead-3 baseline, while our\nML+RL model beats the lead-3 baseline as shown in Table 1. Thus, we conclude that our mixed-\nobjective model obtains a higher ROUGE performance than theirs.\nWe also compare our model against extractive baselines (either lead sentences or lead words) and\nthe extractive summarization model built by Durrett et al. (2016), which was trained using a smaller\nversion of the NYT dataset that is 6 times smaller than ours but contains longer summaries. We\ntrained our ML+RL model on their dataset and show the results on Table 4. Similarly to Durrett\net al. (2016), we report the limited-length ROUGE recall scores instead of full-length F-scores. For\neach example, we limit the generated summary length or the baseline length to the ground truth\nsummary length.

In particular, we want to know whether the ML+RL\ntraining objective did improve readability compared to RL.\nEvaluation setup : To perform this evaluation, we randomly select 100 test examples from the\nCNN/Daily Mail dataset. For each example, we show the original article, the ground truth summary\nas well as summaries generated by different models side by side to a human evaluator. The human\nevaluator does not know which summaries come from which model or which one is the ground truth.\nTwo scores from 1 to 10 are then assigned to each summary, one for relevance (how well does the\nsummary capture the important parts of the article) and one for readability (how well-written the\nsummary is). Each summary is rated by 5 different human evaluators on Amazon Mechanical Turk\nand the results are averaged across all examples and evaluators.\nResults : Our human evaluation results are shown in Table 5. We can see that even though RL\nhas the highest ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L scores, it produces the least readable summaries among\nour experiments. The most common readability issue observed in our RL results, as shown in the\nexample of Table 3, is the presence of short and truncated sentences towards the end of sequences.\nThis con\ufb01rms that optimizing for single discrete evaluation metric such as ROUGE with RL can be\ndetrimental to the model quality.\nOn the other hand, our RL+ML summaries obtain the highest readability and relevance scores among\nour models, hence solving the readability issues of the RL model while also having a higher ROUGE\nscore than ML. This demonstrates the usefulness and value of our RL+ML training method for\nabstractive summarization.",

Ef\ufb01cient summarization with read-\nagain and copy mechanism. arXiv preprint arXiv:1611.03382 , 2016.\nA NYT DATASET\nA.1 P REPROCESSING\nWe remove all documents that do not have a full article text, abstract or headline. We concatenate the\nheadline, byline and full article text, separated by special tokens, to produce a single input sequence\nfor each example. We tokenize the input and abstract pairs with the Stanford tokenizer (Manning\net al., 2014). We convert all tokens to lower-case and replace all numbers with \u201c0\u201d, remove \u201c(s)\u201d and\n\u201c(m)\u201d marks in the abstracts and all occurrences of the following words, singular or plural, if they are\nand \u201cdrawing\u201d. Since the NYT abstracts almost never contain periods, we consider them multi-\nsentence summaries if we split sentences based on semicolons. This allows us to make the summary\nformat and evaluation procedure similar to the CNN/Daily Mail dataset. These pre-processing steps\ngive us an average of 549 input tokens and 40 output tokens per example, after limiting the input\nand output lengths to 800 and 100 tokens.\nA.2 D ATASET SPLITS\nWe created our own training, validation, and testing splits for this dataset. Instead of producing\nrandom splits, we sorted the documents by their publication date in chronological order and used\nthe \ufb01rst 90% (589,284 examples) for training, the next 5% (32,736) for validation, and the remaining\n5% (32,739) for testing. This makes our dataset splits easily reproducible and follows the intuition\nthat if used in a production environment, such a summarization model would be used on recent\narticles rather than random ones.\nA.3 P OINTER SUPERVISION\nWe run each input and abstract sequence through the Stanford named entity recognizer (NER) (Man-\nning et al., 2014). For all named entity tokens in the abstract if the type \u201cPERSON\u201d, \u201cLOCATION\u201d,\n\u201cORGANIZATION\u201d or \u201cMISC\u201d, we \ufb01nd their \ufb01rst occurrence in the input sequence. We use this\ninformation to supervise p(ut)(Equation 11) and \u000be\nti(Equation 4) during training. Note that the\nNER tagger is only used to create the dataset and is no longer needed during testing, thus we\u2019re\nnot adding any dependencies to our model. We also add pointer supervision for out-of-vocabulary\noutput tokens if they are present in the input.\nB H YPERPARAMETERS AND IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS\nFor ML training, we use the teacher forcing algorithm with the only difference that at each decoding\nstep, we choose with a 25% probability the previously generated token instead of the ground-truth\ntoken as the decoder input token yt\u00001, which reduces exposure bias (Venkatraman et al., 2015). We\nuse a\r= 0:9984 for the ML+RL loss function.\nWe use two 200-dimensional LSTMs for the bidirectional encoder and one 400-dimensional LSTM\nfor the decoder. We limit the input vocabulary size to 150,000 tokens, and the output vocabulary to\n50,000 tokens by selecting the most frequent tokens in the training set. Input word embeddings are\n100-dimensional and are initialized with GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014). We train all our models\nwith Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014) with a batch size of 50 and a learning rate \u000bof 0.001 for ML\ntraining and 0.0001 for RL and ML+RL training. At test time, we use beam search of width 5 on all",
