NMTisoftenalargeneuralnetworkthat\nistrainedinanend-to-endfashionandhastheabil-\nitytogeneralizewelltoverylongwordsequences.\nThis means the model does not have to explicitly\nstore gigantic phrase tables and language models\nas in the case of standard MT; hence, NMT has\na small memory footprint. Lastly, implementing\nNMT decoders is easy unlike the highly intricate\ndecoders in standard MT(Koehn et al., 2003).\nIn parallel, the concept of \u201cattention\u201d has\ngained popularity recently in training neural net-\nworks, allowing models to learn alignments be-\ntween different modalities, e.g., between image\nobjects and agent actions in the dynamic con-\ntrol problem (Mnih et al., 2014), between speech\nframes and text in the speech recognition task\n(?), or between visual features of a picture and\nits text description in the image caption gener-\nation task (Xuet al.,2015). In the context of\nNMT,Bahdanau et al. (2015) has successfully ap-\nplied such attentional mechanism to jointly trans-\nlate and align words. To the best of our knowl-\nedge, there has not been any other workexploring\ntheuse of attention-based architectures for NMT.\nfectiveness in mind, two novel types of attention-\nbased models: a globalapproach in which all\nsourcewordsareattendedanda localonewhereby\nonly a subset of source words are considered at a\ntime. The former approach resembles the model\nof (Bahdanau et al., 2015) but is simpler architec-\nturally. The latter can be viewed as an interesting\nblend between the hardandsoftattention models\nproposed in (Xuet al., 2015): it is computation-\nally less expensive than the global model or the\nsoft attention; atthesametime, unlike thehardat-\ntention, the local attention is differentiable almost\neverywhere, making it easier to implement and\ntrain.2Besides, we also examine various align-\nment functions for our attention-based models.\nExperimentally, we demonstrate that both of\nour approaches are effective in the WMT trans-\nlation tasks between English and German in both\ndirections. Our attentional models yield a boost\nof up to 5.0 BLEU over non-attentional systems\nwhich already incorporate known techniques such\nas dropout. For English to German translation,\nwe achieve new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results\nfor both WMT\u201914 and WMT\u201915, outperforming\nprevious SOTA systems, backed by NMT mod-\nels andn-gram LM rerankers, by more than 1.0\nBLEU.
