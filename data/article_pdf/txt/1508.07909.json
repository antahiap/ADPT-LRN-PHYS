However, the translation of rare words\nis an open problem. The vocabulary of neu-\nral models is typically limited to 30000\u201350000\nwords,but translation isanopen-vocabulary prob-\nlem, and especially for languages with produc-\ntive word formation processes such as aggluti-\nnation and compounding, translation models re-\nquire mechanisms that go below the word level.\nAs an example, consider compounds such as the\nGermanAbwasser |behandlungs |anlange\u2018sewage\nwater treatment plant\u2019, for which a segmented,\nvariable-length representation is intuitively more\nappealingthanencodingthewordasa\ufb01xed-length\nvector.\nFor word-level NMT models, the translation\nof out-of-vocabulary words has been addressed\nthrough aback-off toadictionary look-up (Jeanet\nal., 2015; Luong et al., 2015b). We note that such\ntechniques make assumptions that often do not\nhold true in practice. For instance, there is not al-\nwaysa1-to-1correspondence between sourceand\ntarget words because of variance in the degree of\nmorphological synthesis between languages, like\nin our introductory compounding example. Also,\nword-level models are unable to translate or gen-\nerateunseen words. Copying unknownwordsinto\nthetargettext,asdoneby(Jeanetal.,2015;Luong\net al., 2015b), is a reasonable strategy for names,\nbut morphological changes and transliteration is\noften required, especially if alphabets differ.\nWeinvestigate NMTmodelsthat operate onthe\nlevel of subword units. Our main goal is to model\nopen-vocabulary translation in the NMT network\nitself, without requiring a back-off model for rare\nwords. In addition to making the translation pro-\ncesssimpler,wealso\ufb01ndthatthesubwordmodels\nachieve better accuracy for the translation of rare\nwords than large-vocabulary models and back-off\ndictionaries, and are able to productively generate\nnewwordsthatwerenotseenattrainingtime.

We \ufb01nd our\narchitecture simpler and more effective than\nusing large vocabularies and back-off dictio-\nnaries(Jeanetal.,2015;Luongetal.,2015b).\n\u2022 We adapt byte pair encoding (BPE) (Gage,\n1994), a compression algorithm, to the task\nof word segmentation.

If\nalphabets differ, transliteration is required (Dur-\nrani et al., 2014). Character-based translation has\nalso been investigated with phrase-based models,\nwhich proved especially successful for closely re-\nlated languages (Vilar et al., 2007; Tiedemann,\n2009; Neubig et al.,2012).\nThe segmentation of morphologically complex\nwordssuchascompoundsiswidelyusedforSMT,\nand various algorithms for morpheme segmen-\ntation have been investigated (Nie\u00dfen and Ney,\n2000; Koehn and Knight, 2003; Virpioja et al.,\n2007; Stallard et al., 2012). Segmentation al-\ngorithms commonly used for phrase-based SMT\ntend tobeconservative intheir splitting decisions,\nwhereas we aim for an aggressive segmentation\nthat allows for open-vocabulary translation with a\ncompact network vocabulary, and without having\ntoresort to back-off dictionaries.\nThe best choice of subword units may be task-\nspeci\ufb01c.

An effort to apply such techniques\nto NMT, parallel to ours, has found no signi\ufb01cant\nimprovement over word-based approaches (Ling\net al., 2015b). One technical difference from our\nwork is that the attention mechanism still oper-\nates on the level of words in the model by Ling\net al.

Since our\nmain claim is concerned with the translation of\nrare and unseen words, we report separate statis-\ntics for these. We measure these through unigram\nF1, which we calculate as the harmonic mean of\nclipped unigram precision and recall.6\nWe perform all experiments with Groundhog7\n(Bahdanau et al., 2015). We generally follow set-\ntings by previous work (Bahdanau et al., 2015;\nJean et al., 2015). All networks have a hidden\nlayer size of 1000, and an embedding layer size\nof620. FollowingJeanetal.(2015), weonlykeep\nashortlist of \u03c4= 30000 words inmemory.\nDuringtraining,weuseAdadelta(Zeiler,2012),\na minibatch size of 80, and reshuf\ufb02e the train-\ning set between epochs. We train a network for\napproximately 7 days, then take the last 4 saved\nmodels (models being saved every 12 hours), and\ncontinue training each with a \ufb01xed embedding\nlayer (as suggested by (Jean et al., 2015)) for 12\nhours. We perform two independent training runs\nfor each models, once with cut-off for gradient\nclipping (Pascanu et al., 2013) of 5.0, once with\na cut-off of 1.0 \u2013 the latter produced better single\nmodels for most settings. We report results of the\nsystemthatperformedbestonourdevelopmentset\n(newstest2013), and of an ensemble of all 8 mod-\nels.\nWe use a beam size of 12 for beam search,\nwith probabilities normalized by sentence length.\nWe use a bilingual dictionary based on fast-align\n(Dyer et al., 2013). For our baseline, this serves\nas back-off dictionary for rare words. Wealso use\nthe dictionary to speed up translation for all ex-\nperiments, only performing thesoftmax over a\ufb01l-\ntered list of candidate translations (like Jean et al.\n(2015), weuse K= 30000;K\u2032= 10).",

To further illustrate\nthe effect of different subword segmentations on\nthe translation of rare and unseen words, we plot\ntarget-side words sorted by their frequency in the\ntraining set.13To analyze the effect of vocabulary\nsize,wealsoincludethesystem C2-3/500k ,which\nis a system with the same vocabulary size as the\nWDict baseline, and character bigrams to repre-\nsent unseen words.\nFigure 2 shows results for the English\u2013German\nensemble systems on newstest2015. Unigram\nF1of all systems tends to decrease for lower-\nfrequency words. Thebaseline system has a spike\nin F1for OOVs, i.e. words that do not occur in\nthe training text. This is because a high propor-\ntion of OOVs are names, for which a copy from\nthe source to the target text is a good strategy for\nEnglish\u2192German.\nThesystemswithatargetvocabularyof500000\nwords mostly differ in how well they translate\nwords with rank > 500000. A back-off dictionary\nis an obvious improvement over producing UNK,\nbutthesubwordsystemC2-3/500k achievesbetter\nperformance. Note that all OOVs that the back-\noff dictionary produces are words that are copied\nfromthesource,usuallynames,whilethesubword\n13systems can productively form new words such as\ncompounds.\nFor the 50000 most frequent words, the repre-\nsentation is the same for all neural networks, and\nall neural networks achieve comparable unigram\nF1for this category. For the interval between fre-\nquency rank 50000 and 500000, the comparison\nbetween C2-3/500k and C2-50k unveils an inter-\nesting difference. The two systems only differ in\nthesizeoftheshortlist, withC2-3/500k represent-\ning words in this interval as single units, and C2-\n50k via subword units. We \ufb01nd that the perfor-\nmance of C2-3/500k degrades heavily up to fre-\nquency rank 500000, at which point the model\nswitches to a subword representation and perfor-\nmance recovers. The performance of C2-50k re-\nmains more stable. We attribute this to the fact\nthat subword units are less sparse than words. In\nour training set, the frequency rank 50000 corre-\nsponds to a frequency of 60 in the training data;\nthe frequency rank 500000 to a frequency of 2.\nBecause subword representations are less sparse,\nreducing the size of the network vocabulary, and\nrepresenting more words via subword units, can\nlead tobetter performance.\nThe F1numbers hide some qualitative differ-\nences between systems. For English \u2192German,\nWDict produces few OOVs (26.5% recall), but\nwithhighprecision(60.6%),whereasthesubword\nsystemsachievehigher recall, butlowerprecision.\nWe note that the character bigram model C2-50k\nproduces the most OOV words, and achieves rel-\natively low precision of 29.1% for this category.\nHowever, it outperforms the back-off dictionary\nin recall (33.0%). BPE-60k, which suffers from\ntransliteration (or copy) errors due to segmenta-\ntion inconsistencies, obtains a slightly better pre-\ncision(32.4%),butaworserecall(26.6%). Incon-\ntrast to BPE-60k, the joint BPEencoding of BPE-\nJ90k improves both precision (38.6%) and recall\n(29.8%).\nFor English\u2192Russian, unknown names can\nonly rarely be copied, and usually require translit-\neration. Consequently, the WDict baseline per-\nforms more poorly for OOVs (9.2% precision;\n5.2% recall), and the subword models improve\nboth precision and recall (21.9% precision and\n15.6% recall for BPE-J90k).

        "text": "The main contribution of this paper is that we\nshow that neural machine translation systems are\ncapable of open-vocabulary translation by repre-\nsenting rare and unseen words as a sequence of\nsubword units.14This is both simpler and more\neffective than using a back-off translation model.\nWe introduce a variant of byte pair encoding for\nword segmentation, which is capable of encod-\ning open vocabularies with a compact symbol vo-\ncabulary of variable-length subword units. We\nshow performance gains over the baseline with\nbothBPEsegmentation, andasimplecharacter bi-\ngram segmentation.\nOur analysis shows that not only out-of-\nvocabulary words, but also rare in-vocabulary\nwords are translated poorly by our baseline NMT\n14system, and that reducing the vocabulary size\nof subword models can actually improve perfor-\nmance. Inthiswork,ourchoiceofvocabulary size\nis somewhat arbitrary, and mainly motivated by\ncomparison to prior work. One avenue of future\nresearchistolearntheoptimalvocabulary sizefor\na translation task, which we expect to depend on\nthe language pair and amount of training data, au-\ntomatically. We also believe there is further po-\ntential in bilingually informed segmentation algo-\nrithms to create more alignable subword units, al-\nthough the segmentation algorithm cannot rely on\nthetarget text at runtime.\nWhile the relative effectiveness will depend on\nlanguage-speci\ufb01c factors such as vocabulary size,\nwe believe that subword segmentations are suit-\nable for most language pairs, eliminating the need\nfor large NMTvocabularies or back-off models.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Maja Popovi \u00b4c for her implementa-\ntion of CHRF, with which we veri\ufb01ed our re-\nimplementation.
